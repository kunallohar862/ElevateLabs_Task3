# SQL Concepts and Practice

This document explains important SQL concepts through a continuous flow of examples.

## Basic SQL Operations

SQL operations often begin with retrieving data using the `SELECT` statement. For example:

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM students;
Filtering records is done with WHERE:

```sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name FROM students WHERE age > 18;
To sort results, we use ORDER BY:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;
When grouping records and applying aggregation, GROUP BY is used:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
Joins
In relational databases, combining data from different tables is a common task achieved using JOINS.

An INNER JOIN retrieves matching records from both tables:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT s.name, c.course_name
FROM students s
INNER JOIN courses c ON s.course_id = c.course_id;
A LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT s.name, c.course_name
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN courses c ON s.course_id = c.course_id;
A RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the right table and any matched records from the left:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT s.name, c.course_name
FROM students s
RIGHT JOIN courses c ON s.course_id = c.course_id;
Subqueries
Subqueries allow nesting one query within another to make queries more dynamic and powerful. For example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name
FROM students
WHERE department_id = (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
    WHERE department_name = 'Computer Science'
);
Aggregate Functions
SQL provides aggregate functions for summarizing data.

To calculate the total salary:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;
To find the average age:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT AVG(age) FROM students;
Other useful aggregate functions include COUNT(), MAX(), and MIN().

Views
Views are virtual tables based on the result of a query and help simplify data analysis and enhance security.

Creating a view for average student age per department:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE VIEW student_summary AS
SELECT department_id, AVG(age) AS avg_age
FROM students
GROUP BY department_id;
Querying the view:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM student_summary WHERE avg_age > 20;
Query Optimization with Indexes
To improve query performance, especially on large datasets, indexes are used.

Creating an index:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE INDEX idx_student_age ON students(age);
However, excessive indexing should be avoided because it can slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

Conclusion
Mastering these SQL fundamentals â€” data retrieval, joining tables, using subqueries, applying aggregate functions, creating views, and optimizing queries with indexes â€” is crucial for developing efficient, scalable database solutions and ensuring better data management in real-world applications.
